        The goal of this project is to collect as many recordings from native Mandarin Chinese speakers.
        These recordings will be used to help students learning Mandarin Chinese practice their tone recognition.

    After registration you can go the recording page. There you will be shown
    pinyin you can record using the record button. Click on the stop button
    when you finish recording and press the play button to listen to your
    recording. Restart your recording if necessary or click on the upload
    button to upload your recording. Once the recording is uploaded a new
    pinyin word to be recorded will appear.<br>
    You can do as many recordings as you like, and come back any time to the recording
    page to do more recordings.<br>
    here is an example of some pinyin and the recordings:
    {% endblocktrans %} </p>
    <lu>
    <li>
        <p>{% trans "mā as in 妈 (first tone)" %}</p>
        <audio controls=true></audio>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> {% trans "má as in 麻 (second tone)" %}</p>
        <audio controls=true></audio>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>{% trans "mǎ as in 马 (third tone)" %}</p>
        <audio controls=true></audio>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>{% trans "mà as in 骂 (forth tone)" %}</p>
        <audio controls=true></audio>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>{% trans "ma as in 吗 (fifth/zeroth/no tone)" %}</p>
        <audio controls=true></audio>
    </li>
    </lu>
    <p> {% blocktrans %}
    If you record multiple syllables at once, for example: "mā rì pǐng", try to
    pronounce them as if it was one word. Any combination that has a meaning is
    pure coincidence.
    {% endblocktrans %} </p>
    <li>
        <p>mā rì pǐng</p>
        <audio controls=true></audio>
    </li>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
